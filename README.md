# HasheeBird - Another one PoC for Monero in-game mining (Coinhive)

HasheeBird is proof-of-concept and a fast, hacky realisation of FlappyBird game. <br>
Some Mario game rules were added, so HasheeBird is more than another FlappyBird HTML5 clone. :thumbsup:

## How it's look?

HasheeBird can be fully customized, but I prefer to use old-school Nintendo-like style.

## Rules

* Hit space to make bird fly. <br>
* Each heart :heart: adds  +1 to your lives.<br>
* When you hit pipes or fall down your lives decrease and bird starts to be immortal (blinks) until proof-of-work be fully finished <br>
* When your lives are less than 0 - you lose. :scream: <br>
* The immortal time depends on the speed of resolving the Monero hashes. <br>


## How can I try this incredible thing?
